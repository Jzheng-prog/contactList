# contactList
Final Project

● Overview of the project.
For this project, we aim to solve problems for people who are too popular or have a
messy contact list. In order to solve this problem, we take in a list of contacts and parse
through it. Using python regex functionalities, we can find specific information to
organize such as phone number, email, name, and addresses.
● Scope of the project. 
Our project will only organize and sort the contact information. We can sort these
information by the name, email, number, or address depending on what the user wants.
We may also include the function of organizing information by ascending or descending
order. However, we will not be able to change/update any of the information. For
example, we will also not be able to add on or delete the information.
